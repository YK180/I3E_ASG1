Overview

This is Unity based first-person game project designed for PC. It features exploring the map and collecting of coins, with different obstacles to cross to survive death. Find your way through the challenges and collect all the coins to win the game.

The player spawns in a room where he has to collect all 20 coins that are spread across the map to win. first thing he has to do is to interact with the door, which will prompt a message saying the keycard is required. Then the player will explore the room to find a keycard while collecting coins that are in the room, once the player found the keycard, the player has to interact and pick it up then he/she is able to unlock the door. After unlocking the door the player has to make it through the parkour with out missing a step. After the parkour the player will have to crawl through a vent to reach the maze. The player would then have to collect the coins in the maze while avoiding touching the walls that will damage the player and find the exit door. After finding and opening the door the player would have to complete one last parkour to reach the ending where the rest of the coins are located. When the player collects all the coins the gamr will end.
